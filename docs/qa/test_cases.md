# JW Player - Test Cases

Lives in `jw_player_automation` (not `jw_player`) - this repo owns the whole
QA layer: test cases here, automation scripts alongside them. Maps to
[user_stories.md](https://github.com/jwallis/jw_player/blob/main/docs/qa/user_stories.md)
in `jw_player` (PLAYER-001 .. PLAYER-025) - that file is a frozen retroactive
backlog and stays there, it isn't part of this repo's ongoing automation.
IDs are sequential across the whole file: PLAYER_TC-001+.
"Automatable (Appium)" reflects practical UI-automation feasibility, not
theoretical possibility (e.g. system file-picker dialogs and internal
player-volume/timing state are marked No even though Appium can technically
reach across apps, because they are flaky/opaque in practice).
"Jira Issue ID" is the Jira key of the user story that caused this test case to
be written. The 42 retroactive cases below were backfilled with real keys
(PLAYER-NNN -> JWP-(NNN+3), a flat offset confirmed against 4 spot-checked
imports spanning the full range) once the corresponding user stories were
imported into Jira - no longer TBD.

## Test Data / Fixture Setup

Unless a test case says otherwise, assume this folder tree exists under a
root folder that has already been granted to the app:

```
Root/
  FolderA/
    FolderA1/                 (contains 2 playable audio files)
    track_a1.mp3               (~10s)
    track_a2.mp3               (~10s)
  .hidden_folder/               (name starts with ".")
  .hidden_track.mp3             (name starts with ".")
  mixed_ext/
    song.mp3
    song.m4a
    song.wav
    song.flac                   (unsupported extension)
    notes.txt                   (unsupported extension)
  many_items/                   (30+ folders/files - more than one screen)
  seek_test.mp3                 (exactly 60s duration, no ID3 artist tag)
  Long Track With A Really Long Title And Artist Name.mp3
                                 (~90s, has an ID3 artist tag; title+artist
                                  combined text is wider than the screen)

white_noise_sample.mp3           (short file, ~5s, picked separately via
                                  the white-noise file picker, does not
                                  need to live under Root/)
```

TC IDs below reference files from this tree by name.

**Priority:** Medium
**Automatable (Appium):** Yes
**Test Data:** "Long Track With A Really Long Title And Artist Name.mp3" (has
           an ID3 artist tag); Root/seek_test.mp3 (no artist tag)
**Steps:**
 1. Play seek_test.mp3.
    Expected: Mini player shows just the title text (no " - " separator),
    since there is no artist metadata.
 2. Play "Long Track With A Really Long Title And Artist Name.mp3".
    Expected: Mini player shows "<Artist> - <Title>" on a single line.
---
### PLAYER_TC-017: Title/artist text that overflows the screen width scrolls (marquee)
**Story:** PLAYER-013

                       visual/frame comparison beyond standard element
                       assertions)
**Test Data:** "Long Track With A Really Long Title And Artist Name.mp3"
**Steps:**
 1. Play the long-titled track.
 2. Observe the title/artist line for several seconds.
    Expected: The text scrolls horizontally (marquee) since it is wider
    than the screen; a short title (e.g. seek_test.mp3) does not scroll.
---
